# Research Data Integration Project
---
## Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to **automate the integration of information from the Top 3 researchers** of the Innovation Center.  
This automation ensures accurate, updated, and accessible research information while reducing manual work and errors.

---

## Key Functionalities
- **Google Scholar API Integration**: Extracts relevant researcher data (publications, citations, profiles).  
- **JSON to Database Mapping**: Transforms JSON responses from the API into the database structure.  
- **Java Application**: Handles data extraction, processing, and integration into the research database.  
- **Version Control in GitHub**: Centralized repository for source code, technical documentation, and development history.  

---

## Project Relevance
Currently, research information is collected manually, which is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.  
This project:
- **Automates the process** of retrieving data from Google Scholar.  
- **Improves efficiency** by reducing repetitive tasks.  
- **Ensures reliability** of the data stored in the institutional research database.  
- **Supports collaboration** among team members by providing centralized access through GitHub.
